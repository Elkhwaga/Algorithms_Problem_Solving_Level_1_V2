# 🚀 C++ Programming Journey: Engineering Approach

Welcome to my repository for C++ Level 1 challenges. This project goes beyond basic problem-solving by applying **Software Engineering Principles** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 🛠 Architectural Overview
I follow a **Layered Architecture (Separation of Concerns)** to ensure code is clean and scalable:

* **Domain/Business Logic:** Core logic encapsulated in specialized classes (e.g., `NumberChecker`).
* **Infrastructure/Utility:** Generic helpers for input validation and stream management (e.g., `InputReader`, `Utils`).
* **Presentation Layer:** Handles data formatting and console output (e.g., `Presenter`, `ResultFormatter`).
* **Control Layer:** The `ApplicationFlow` orchestrator that manages the execution sequence.



## 📂 Problem Index

| # | Problem Title | Core Concepts | Solution Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Print Your Name | OOP Basics, Layered Design | [View Code](./01_Print_Your_Name) |
| 02 | Read & Print Name | Input Validation, String Trimming | [View Code](./02_Read_And_Print_Name) |
| 03 | Odd or Even | Enums, Namespaces, Error Handling | [View Code](./03_Check_Even_Odd_Number) |


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio** or any C++ IDE.
3. Compile and run the desired `.cpp` file.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* Mastering C++ syntax and STL.
* Writing **Clean Code** that is easy to read and maintain.
* Developing an "Engineering Mindset" for large-scale system design.
