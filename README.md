# 🚀 C++ Programming Journey: Engineering Approach

Welcome to my repository for C++ Level 1 challenges. This project goes beyond basic problem-solving by applying **Software Engineering Principles** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 🛠 Architectural Overview
I follow a **Layered Architecture (Separation of Concerns)** to ensure code is clean, maintainable, and scalable:

* **Domain/Business Logic:** Core logic encapsulated in specialized classes (e.g., `NumberChecker`, `EligibilityChecker`).
* **Infrastructure/Utility:** Generic helpers for input validation, string manipulation, and stream management (e.g., `InputReader`, `Utils`).
* **Presentation Layer:** Handles data formatting and console output (e.g., `ResultFormatter`, `Presenter`).
* **Control Layer:** The `ApplicationFlow` orchestrator that manages the execution sequence and connects all layers.



## 📂 Problem Index

| # | Problem Title | Core Concepts | Solution Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Print Your Name | OOP Basics, Layered Design | [View Code](./01_Print_Your_Name/01_Print_Your_Name_OOP.cpp) |
| 02 | Read & Print Name | Input Validation, String Trimming | [View Code](./02_Read_And_Print_Name/02_Read_And_Print_Name_OOP.cpp) |
| 03 | Odd or Even | Enums, Namespaces, Error Handling | [View Code](./03_Check_Even_Odd_Number/03_Check_Even_Odd_Number_OOP.cpp) |
| 04 | Hire a Driver (Case 1) | Business Logic Isolation, Multi-Criteria Validation | [View Code](./04_Hire_A_Driver_Case_1/04_Hire_A_Driver_Case_1_OOP.cpp) |

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Elkhwaga/Algorithms_Problem_Solving_Level_1_V2.git`
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C++ IDE.
3. Each problem is contained in its own directory with a dedicated README explaining the logic.
4. Compile and run the desired `.cpp` file.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* Mastering C++ syntax and STL (Standard Template Library).
* Writing **Clean Code** that is easy for other developers to read and maintain.
* Developing an "Engineering Mindset" before moving to advanced software architecture levels.
