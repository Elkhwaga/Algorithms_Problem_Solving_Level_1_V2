# 🚀 C++ Programming Journey: Engineering Approach

Welcome to my repository for C++ Level 1 challenges. This project isn't just about finding solutions; it's about applying **Software Engineering Principles** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** from the very first line of code.

## 🛠 Architectural Overview
To ensure scalability and maintainability, I follow a **Layered Architecture (Separation of Concerns)** in my solutions:

* **Data Model Layer (`Person`):** Responsible for data structure and encapsulation.
* **Input Layer (`InputReader`):** Handles secure, validated, and trimmed user input.
* **Presentation Layer (`Presenter`):** Manages how information is formatted and displayed to the console.
* **Control Layer (`ApplicationFlow`):** The orchestrator that manages the execution logic and connects all layers.

| # | Problem Title | Core Concepts | Solution Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Print Your Name | OOP Basics, Layered Design | [View Code](./01_Print_Your_Name) |
| 02 | Read & Print Name | Input Validation, String Trimming | [View Code](./02_Read_And_Print_Name) |
| 03 | Odd or Even | Logic Branching, Flow Control | [Coming Soon] |

## 🎯 Project Goals
* Mastering C++ syntax and STL.
* Writing **Clean Code** that is easy to read and maintain.
* Developing an "Engineering Mindset" before moving to advanced software architecture levels.
